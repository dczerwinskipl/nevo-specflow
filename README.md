**Nevo SpecFlow** is a spec-driven development framework for AI-assisted software
engineering: a human-led, spec-anchored workflow delivered as a CLI (`nevo-specflow`), a local Runtime, and an interactive UI.

- **Human-led.** The repository owner makes the architectural and scope calls; AI agents
  propose options and implement approved work inside an explicitly declared context.
- **Spec-anchored.** Non-trivial changes are tied to a specification, classified by
  weight, with explicit owner approval gates.
- **Deterministic and tool-enforced.** The spec/task lifecycle and documentation
  discovery run through commands with stable, machine-readable output.
- **Vendor-neutral.** The workflow is exposed to AI coding agents through thin adapters
  over a single source of truth.

See [`docs/product/specflow/overview.md`](docs/product/specflow/overview.md) for the
product overview and [`docs/`](docs/README.md) for everything else.

## Getting started

```bash
corepack enable                 # once per machine
pnpm install                    # Node 24 LTS (.nvmrc), pnpm 10 via Corepack
pnpm check                      # the full local quality gate
```

`pnpm check` runs format, lint, documentation validation, the version-metadata gate,
and every package's typecheck / test / build. Full setup and the command reference:
[`docs/engineering/repository/local-setup.md`](docs/engineering/repository/local-setup.md).
