# Architecture Decision Records

An ADR records a decision that is **durable** and **cross-cutting** — it shapes how
future work is done. Routine local choices do not get an ADR.

Format: [`../../templates/adr-template.md`](../../templates/adr-template.md). Files are
numbered `NNNN-kebab-title.md`. A superseded ADR keeps `status: superseded` and points
to its replacement.
