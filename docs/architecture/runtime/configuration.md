# Project configuration and local state

Nevo SpecFlow uses one repository namespace:

```text
.nevo/
├── config.yaml                 # committed product configuration container
├── agent-instructions.md       # committed
├── agents/                     # committed definitions/instructions
├── workflows/                  # committed deterministic workflow definitions when migrated
└── local/                      # entirely Git-ignored
    ├── config.yaml             # workstation/operator configuration + secrets
    └── state/                  # application-owned local persistence as capabilities migrate
```

The canonical ignore entry is:

```gitignore
.nevo/local/
```

Do not introduce a sibling `.nevo-local/` namespace.

## Ownership

The product owns the **configuration containers and composition**, not the meaning of capability
settings. It owns Git-root discovery, the `.nevo/` namespace, file locations, ignore rules,
serialization, and the top-level namespaces contributed by capabilities.

Current shape:

```yaml
runtime:
  server: ...
  authentication: ...
```

Runtime owns everything inside the `runtime` subtree. Within Runtime, authentication owns `authentication` and Runtime
server composition owns `server`. Runtime initialization (`initRuntime`) owns their prompts,
defaults, project/local split, password hashing, secret policy, merge rules, and validation.

The product initializer calls `initRuntime`, wraps its contribution under `runtime`, and writes
the aggregate documents without reconstructing Runtime settings.

Server provenance is explicit too: `host`, `port`, `publicOrigin`, and `tls.enabled` are
project-owned policy. Workstation-local Runtime config may supply only TLS certificate/key paths.
The merged Runtime config is validated after composition, so local credentials cannot weaken
project-owned authentication or server policy.

This namespace boundary is deliberate. Future AI, workflow, repository, or integration
configuration can add their own top-level capability namespace without becoming an unknown Runtime
key. Runtime config loading extracts only `runtime` before applying Runtime validation.

## Project versus local

`.nevo/config.yaml` contains source-controlled configuration that should follow the project.

`.nevo/local/config.yaml` mirrors the same capability namespaces for workstation-specific values
and secrets. It is **not** a general override layer. Provenance is validated before merge.

Current ownership is explicit:

- `server`: project owns `host`, `port`, `publicOrigin`, and `tls.enabled`; local owns
  `tls.certFile` and `tls.keyFile`.
- `authentication`: project owns `mode`, `users`, provider `enabled`, and OIDC
  `issuer`/`clientId`/`allowedEmails`; local owns `localUserId`, password `accounts`, and
  OIDC `clientSecret`.

A local file that attempts to set project-owned policy is rejected before composition. Likewise,
project config cannot contain local-owned credentials or workstation-specific TLS paths.

`.nevo/local/state/` is reserved for application-owned data such as Session bindings,
transcript/read-model caches, workflow operation records, human-verification records, provider
aliases, and bounded diagnostics. Users should not treat that state as editable configuration.

## Definitions are not flattened into config.yaml

Large declarative definitions keep their own committed files. Agent definitions already live under
`.nevo/agents/`; deterministic workflow definitions will live under `.nevo/workflows/` when
that capability is migrated. Aggregate config may select/default such definitions, but should not
absorb their full bodies.

## Initialization

`nevo-specflow init` owns repository bootstrap only:

- discover the Git repository root;
- create `.nevo/config.yaml` and `.nevo/local/config.yaml`;
- ensure `.nevo/local/` is ignored and verify the concrete local config path with Git;
- compose and serialize capability-owned contributions;
- write local config first and committed config last as the success marker, rolling back on failure.

The product shell resolves the Git repository root for both `init` and `start`, then passes
absolute config paths and the project root into Runtime. Runtime does not discover product file
locations from `process.cwd()`.

Runtime setup first decides whether authentication is required. Required authentication can combine
username/password with one or more named OIDC instances; at least one login method must remain
enabled. Password setup hashes secrets inside Runtime, while every OIDC client secret stays local.

For a new password user, the username is also the canonical user id; the wizard does not ask for a
second technical identifier. Additional password accounts explicitly choose `New user` or
`Existing user`. OIDC identities are configured by allowed email and may likewise create a new
user or link to an existing one, but their human-facing profile data comes from verified OIDC claims
at sign-in rather than from init prompts.

A role is selected immediately whenever setup creates a new user. The first-created user defaults to
`admin`; subsequent users default to `developer`. Setup preserves creation order explicitly and
cannot finish without at least one administrator. Trusted local mode keeps its local identity without
showing a login screen.

Before the product shell asks to write files, Runtime contributes a human-readable review of its
non-secret choices: authentication mode and methods, named OIDC instances and ids, issuer/client id,
identity-to-user mappings, canonical users, and role assignments. Passwords, hashes, client secrets,
and other workstation-local secrets are never included in that review.
