# Git workflow

## Branch model

```text
main                     next development version — always ahead of the latest release
  ← squash-merged PR
  ← feature/<slug>        new capability or behavior
  ← fix/<slug>            bug fix (targets main, or a release line for a hotfix)

release/v<major>.<minor>  one long-lived branch per maintained minor line (e.g. release/v1.3)
```

Short-lived `docs/<slug>` and `chore/<slug>` prefixes follow the same PR rules as
`feature/`.

`release/v1.3` owns the entire `1.3.x` maintenance line: every `1.3.x` patch is a tag
on `release/v1.3`, so the branch name stays at minor granularity.

## Core rules

- **No direct commits to `main` or `release/v*`.** Both are protected; all changes
  arrive by pull request.
- **Squash merge only.** Merge commits and rebase merges are disabled on the repository.
- The **PR title becomes the squash commit message** and must follow
  [Conventional Commits](commit-conventions.md).
- **Checkpoint commits on a feature branch may be informal** — they are squashed away.
  Do not rewrite/force-push someone else's feature branch to "tidy" history.
- **Linear history** is required on protected branches; force-pushes and branch
  deletion are blocked there.
- Review conversations must be **resolved** and required **CI checks green** before a PR
  merges. Merged head branches are deleted automatically.

Feature and fix branches are **not** protected — you can push, rebase and force-push
your own working branch freely.

## Normal change

```bash
git switch main && git pull
git switch -c feature/short-slug
# ... commit freely ...
git push -u origin feature/short-slug
gh pr create --fill        # edit the title to Conventional Commits form
```

## Maintained release lines

A release line is cut with the **`cut-release-line`** workflow, which takes the release
version and the explicitly chosen next development version (next minor **or** next
major) as inputs — it never infers that choice.

```text
release/v1.3  ──►  stabilizes 1.3.x: beta → rc → stable → patches
main          ──►  1.4.0-alpha.<build>   (or 2.0.0-alpha.<build> if the next work breaks compatibility)
```

The channel model (`beta` / `rc` / `stable`), the intentional prerelease tag sequence
(`v1.3.0-beta.1`, `-beta.2`, `-rc.1`, …), and the `release` workflow are in
[releasing](releasing.md). ADR
[`0003-branch-and-release-model`](../architecture/decisions/0003-branch-and-release-model.md).

## Hotfix on a released line

1. A security/critical issue affects `1.3` while `main` has moved on.
2. `git switch release/v1.3 && git switch -c fix/security-xyz`
3. PR into `release/v1.3` — same review + CI gate, squash merge.
4. Promote and release the patch via the [`release` workflow](releasing.md#releasing-a-version)
   — an optional `v1.3.1-rc.1`, then `v1.3.1`.
5. **Forward-port** the fix to `main` and any other maintained release lines with
   their own PRs.

A hotfix never bypasses review just because it is urgent.
