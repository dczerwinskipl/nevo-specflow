# Offline engine and workspace foundation

## Status and decision discipline

**Exploration only.** This directory is not an accepted ADR, an implementation specification, or a request to modify Runtime/CLI now. Candidate API shapes, packages, error codes, files, locks, and migration destinations are proposals. A later proof of concept must demonstrate the invariants before any normative rule is promoted.

**Baseline:** `main` of `dczerwinskipl/nevo-specflow` at `e0ffd59119abc833f814502db25db84542313e3a` (10 October 2026). **Preview, not baseline:** open PR [#45](https://github.com/dczerwinskipl/nevo-specflow/pull/45), HEAD `612d9c19348d83465fa8d6cfc71d5f9c4d58a4c8` when inspected, stacked on #39, incorporating already merged #44. Revalidate HEAD and merged state before implementation. A feature in #45 is **not** assumed merged or authoritative. See [inspection evidence](baseline-and-evidence.md).

## Design dossier

1. [Baseline and evidence](baseline-and-evidence.md): verified source boundaries, PR #45 versus main, disagreements with current architecture.
2. [Engine, CLI and Runtime boundaries](engine-cli-runtime-boundaries.md): shared use cases, process lifetime, packaging alternatives.
3. [Ownership and state](ownership-and-state.md): product facts, workflow evidence, live Sessions, local authority.
4. [Project and Workspace identity](project-and-workspace-context.md): discovery and identity across checkout roots.
5. [Specification creation vertical slice](specification-creation.md): title-only creation with optional new worktree, CLI and HTTP.
6. [Git capability](git-capability.md): enablement, port and adapter, branch/worktree guards.
7. [Worktree model and lifecycle](optional-worktrees.md): semantics, selection, retention and cleanup.
8. [Workspace registry and reads](workspace-registry-and-discovery.md): deduplication, missing roots, source of truth.
9. [Offline agents and CLI](offline-cli-and-external-agents.md): unsupervised external provider and skills, invisible Sessions.
10. [Locks, claims, admission](locking-and-admission.md): cross-process synchronization and long-lived ownership.
11. [Durable operations and recovery](durable-operations-and-recovery.md): idempotency, crash points, replay.
12. [Runtime API and UI integration](runtime-http-and-reads.md): one use case behind CLI and authenticated HTTP.
13. [Legacy migration](legacy-nevo-migration.md): inspect/port/adapt/reject instructions per subsystem.
14. [Test plan](test-plan.md): actual Git repositories, CLI + server, concurrency and failure injection.
15. [Acceptance criteria](acceptance-criteria.md): independent, measurable release gates.
16. [Open decisions and promotion](decisions-and-promotion.md): alternatives, assumptions, ADR freeze procedure.

## Proposed first experiment

Implement one small vertical slice **on a branch based on current `main` at execution time**, using #45 only to review design direction. Create a Specification with only a title, optionally provision an isolated Git worktree when the Git capability is enabled, discover it from either checkout, read it through actual Runtime HTTP, and use CLI without a running Runtime. Include a minimal cross-process conflict test; **do not** migrate providers, entire workflow engine, task lifecycle, PR finalization, or UI composition for this experiment.

## Non-goals and constraints

- No forced Runtime dependency for specification/workflow CLI commands.
- No invented canonical Session for an external agent; observable workflow progress is distinct from live conversations.
- No parallel legacy/deterministic workflow product modes: only the deterministic model is a migration candidate.
- No generic DI framework or unnecessary npm package explosion.
- No implicit scanning and trusting of all Git worktrees.
- No automatic deletion of worktrees containing unproven or unintegrated work.
- No promotion of these drafts before executable evidence and explicit owner decision.
