# Acceptance criteria — staged proposal

These are **candidate** gates, not adopted production contracts. An implementation is accepted only with executable test IDs, revision/OS evidence and explicit owner sign-off. A `draft` documentation PR cannot claim a passed runtime gate.

## Foundation A — Specs, Project Home, Git Workspaces (first PoC)

**Boundary:** real Spec create/list/read from offline CLI and authenticated HTTP, project/workspace source identity, Git worktree provisioning, registry, creation journal and project/registry mutation serialization. **No workflow start/finish, external execution lease, provider Session or fake workflow API is required to pass A.**

| ID | Acceptance | Required evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FA01 | Runtime stopped: separate CLI processes create/list/resolve a title-only Specification | C01, C04, H02 |
| FA02 | CLI and authenticated HTTP call one application use case; production returns real data without fixture fallback | H01, H02, H04–H06, architecture/import check |
| FA03 | Git feature disabled rejects new worktree **before side effects**; ordinary supported Git-backed Spec create still works | C03 + negative-side-effect snapshot |
| FA04 | Enabled Git creates one verified branch/worktree with untouched primary HEAD/files | C02, C06, C12 |
| FA05 | Primary and linked checkout resolve identical Project Home/local config/registry; independent clone is separate | C10, C11, P01–P04 |
| FA06 | Registered spec has one canonical source; duplicate manifest doesn't duplicate row; missing binding/worktree is not silently read from main | C07–C09, P05 |
| FA07 | Concurrent OS processes serialize spec/branch/registry reservation; no lost update or destructive rollback | L01, L02, L07 |
| FA08 | Crash at each create stage can resume safely, or report actionable ambiguity, with no duplicate spec/worktree and stable idempotency | C05, R01–R05 |
| FA09 | Versioned config/local state, path safety and HTTP permissions fail closed; no invented Runtime Session or shadow product state | H06, H08, C09, C12 |
| FA10 | Known creation scaffold/dirty baseline is documented so later authoring admission need not treat Engine-created files as unknown changes | baseline evidence + design test SC01, not automatic workflow migration |
| FA11 | One installed product CLI remains; Engine has no HTTP/provider/Commander dependency; Windows and POSIX critical Git/process tests run | build/import checks; platform result |
| FA12 | Scope, tradeoffs and unsupported cases are recorded; PR #45 is preview only and all docs/index checks are valid | decision report; `pnpm docs:check` |

**Foundation A acceptance does not imply that workflow or managed agent execution is ready.** If the Project Home mechanism relies on a specific checkout layout, record that supported scope explicitly and prove repair/missing-home behavior; no silent reinitialization.

## Foundation B — Execution coordinator + one real minimal Workflow Kernel

**Boundary:** no provider, no full old Nevo workflow; one representative real deterministic step start/finish, actual attempt identity, effects-based admission, and independent CLI processes. Do **not** satisfy these by a mock endpoint with no workflow state.

| ID | Acceptance | Required evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FB01 | External CLI with Runtime off can inspect/start/finish one real deterministic workflow attempt without fake Session | W01, W02 |
| FB02 | Writer scope is independent of Task/Turn; spec authoring may hold writer without taskId; enforced read-only work does not | W03, W04, SC01 |
| FB03 | Claim outlives short CLI process; concurrent writer blocked; nonconflicting worktrees proceed | L03, L04, W05 |
| FB04 | Release/settlement does not automatically finish Task; explicit finish and attempt-scoped evidence control progression | W02, W06 |
| FB05 | Inspect/reconcile/owner release expose actionable recovery and can automatically clear **proven** settled work; ambiguity escalates rather than blocks silently forever | L05, L06, W07, W08 |
| FB06 | External actor trust and human gate provenance are a documented owner decision; arbitrary owner/role/session string cannot self-approve | W09, AG01–AG03, security review |
| FB07 | Dirty-state admission distinguishes known scaffold from unrelated edits without disabling required clean-tree gates | SC01, SC02 |
| FB08 | No provider/HTTP dependency, import directions and cross-process replay evidence hold after Kernel integration | separate-process test run; dependency check |

**Foundation B pass** means safe offline workflow coordination primitives exist; it does not certify Sessions or provider migrations.

## Sessions Foundation and Managed Execution integration (later independent gate)

Sessions Foundation can be developed against the contract independently of full workflow migration. Managed integration tests require **Foundation B's real coordinator** and a mock provider; actual external providers follow later.

| ID | Acceptance | Required evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SI01 | Canonical product `sessionId` distinct from provider-native `ProviderSessionRef`; stable historical Session/Turn/Work read | S01 + persistence test |
| SI02 | Standalone read-only/ad-hoc Session Turn works without workflow or writer claim when mode genuinely enforced | S01 |
| SI03 | Writable managed Turn uses Engine admission/claim and persists dispatch intent with current workspace root | S02 |
| SI04 | Terminal Turn or handover does not automatically complete/activate a workflow step; batch retains explicit per-Task scope | S03–S05 |
| SI05 | Crash before/during/after provider dispatch does not duplicate unknown tool effects, and settles only proven ownership | S06 |
| SI06 | Move/rebind/unavailable worktree invalidates unsafe native resume while preserving authorized Session history | S07 |
| SI07 | Scoped Session and Spec/Workspace reads don't leak records through cross-feature projections | S08 |
| SI08 | Writer claims can be reconciled independently of provider Session/Turn lifecycle; external work is not fabricated as a managed Session | S02, S06, W08 |

## Deferred rather than falsely accepted

Full provider migration, richer prompts/composer, complete deterministic gate set, Task batch orchestration, automatic Session handover, GitHub/GitLab integration, full finalize, worktree removal UI, multi-machine/network filesystems and strong security against unrestricted same-OS-account adversaries are **not** required by Foundation A/B. Every deferral must identify the future owner and safety boundary; no exposed feature may claim deferred behavior works.

## Promotion / no-go

Freeze normative ADR/architecture only after **both relevant Foundation gates pass** and owner selects Project Home policy, claim recovery, local actor/human approval trust, binding rebind behavior, and import/package shape. Migrate managed Sessions only with an agreed handshake contract. No-go: Runtime is needed for ordinary CLI workflow, a duplicate provider invocation is replayed under unknown outcome, an external claim auto-releases on PID/TTL alone, unauthorized human approval is accepted, or a canonical spec silently falls back to stale main data. Link all accepted choices to real tests and PR commits.
