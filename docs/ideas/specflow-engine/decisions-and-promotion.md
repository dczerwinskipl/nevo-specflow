# Decisions, alternatives and documentation freeze

## Explicit assumptions already expressed by the owner

- Users may start agents outside the SpecFlow Runtime; such agents can work using skills and CLI; their native Sessions need not appear in Runtime.
- Deterministic workflow should function without a running Runtime, with cross-process file-based coordination if proven safe.
- A new Specification may optionally be placed into its own Git worktree, when Git integration is enabled.
- One project should list Specs from the primary checkout and explicitly locally registered linked worktrees, without treating all Git worktrees as product-owned.
- Build/test a narrow real vertical slice first, then freeze tested architecture and write instructions for subsequent legacy Nevo migration.
- Use `main` as source base; PR #45 is **preview of direction** and must not be assumed merged.
- Keep concepts in `docs/ideas/**` until evaluated; many targeted documents are preferable to one monolith.

These are intent/constraints, not approvals of every candidate code shape in this dossier.

## Open decision register

| ID | Question / alternatives | Proposed experiment or evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D01 | New private `@nevo/specflow-engine` package or Runtime sub-entrypoint? | Verify import graph, independent CLI smoke and one bundled artifact; favour package only if separation wins |
| D02 | Where and how to locate the single project state home from a linked checkout? | Primary checkout enumeration, verified Git common-dir, explicit fallback locator, moved-home tests |
| D03 | Is a Git-backed project with disabled Git actions supported while completely non-Git project support stays deferred? | Test disabled capability inside existing Git-backed init without changing unrelated boot contract |
| D04 | Managed worktree naming/root/branch default and override policy? | Windows paths, collisions, existing branch, worktree already checked out |
| D05 | Permit imported unmanaged worktrees and multiple specs in one linked tree? | Start managed one-spec model; define explicit future attach semantics |
| D06 | What exactly is stored in registry/journal versus committed manifest? | Restore after crash; verify no conflicting canonical status |
| D07 | External execution claim identity, proof, renewal and release when CLI ends? | Two-process conflict, invisible provider, no heartbeat, dead PID, unknown claim |
| D08 | How does offline CLI actor attribution/authorization relate to Runtime HTTP Auth? | Document local trust boundary; reject untrusted owner/session handles |
| D09 | Which operation stages require durable intent, how long retain evidence? | Failure injection at each stage, repeat same operation ID |
| D10 | Which Runtime read repositories consume Engine directly versus composition read projections? | Compare main and #45 preview endpoints, no fixture production fallback |
| D11 | Which interface surfaces show unavailable worktree/blocked external execution? | Read-model semantic tests before UI design |
| D12 | Cleanup/archival and Git PR merge policy after initial PoC? | Explicit later slice, do not hardcode old single-checkout finalize |
| D13 | Whether to auto-commit created scaffold or leave uncommitted? | Check UX, dirty-gate implications and crash/idempotency |
| D14 | Is local filesystem-only coordination a documented constraint or do we need shared/network support? | Initial support only local supported filesystems; defer network/multi-host |
| D15 | Where to run two-level lock coordination and what order? | Cross-process deadlock and crash scenarios |
| D16 | Config namespace, default Git enablement and capability discovery API? | Product config provenance / local override policy review |

**Do not silently decide D02, D07, D08 or D09 while implementing a happy-path create endpoint.** They determine actual correctness. The PoC may narrow its supported cases explicitly while demonstrating chosen behavior.

## Alternatives and why they are not the first approach

- **All workflow through Runtime HTTP:** simplest single owner process, but breaks unattended CLI/skills when server off.
- **Runtime launches CLI subprocess for each command:** reuses code superficially; leaks CLI output, process invocation and lifecycle into server semantics; creates duplicated error and cancellation paths.
- **Every agent must register a Runtime Session:** not possible for arbitrary externally launched agent without losing offline independence.
- **Short lock only:** insufficient while an external agent edits after CLI exits.
- **Database daemon for lock registry:** could simplify transactional state but introduces a process/runtime dependency; not justified before testing filesystem coordination.
- **Worktree mandatory:** changes current simple workflow and multiplies storage/infrastructure; user wants optional.
- **One Runtime per worktree:** duplicates managed sessions/ports and complicates unified Overview.
- **Everything in a single YAML config:** confuses human policy with machine-managed journal/registry, complicates safe mutation.
- **Mirror every spec manifest into central state:** creates competing sources of truth with divergent branches.
- **Package per small concern:** unnecessary boundaries; verify one Engine source boundary before splitting further.

## Implementation-to-decision pipeline

1. Start from freshest main; read accepted docs and PR #45 as **unmerged reference**.
2. Write implementation-specific mini-spec for `create Specification` + optional worktree, referencing this dossier.
3. Build offline Engine + CLI + real Git fixture tests; only enough Runtime HTTP to exercise same operation.
4. Exercise concurrency, missing worktree, restart and crash stage tests. Record open decisions and failures.
5. Conduct independent architecture/code review. Compare actual dependency graph to acceptance criteria.
6. Make explicit owner decisions for open tradeoffs. Record accepted facts with test/PR/commit evidence.
7. Create/modify normative architecture/engineering docs and ADRs in their actual homes (not `ideas`). Consider a new ADR for offline Engine ownership, and update ADR 0012, runtime ownership, configuration and deterministic workflow docs as needed.
8. Create the detailed legacy migration instruction/matrix against newly accepted contracts; mark/supersede this idea when appropriate. Later implementation agents should not mistake draft proposals for instructions.

## What an ADR should freeze

- Offline Engine callable from CLI and Runtime, authority for Specs/Workflow operations, permitted dependency directions.
- Ownership of local state, short locks, long claims and process-neutral recovery.
- Stable Project/Workspace/Spec identity and source-binding precedence.
- Optional Git capability, worktree lifecycle and hard safety boundaries.
- Runtime ownership restricted to actually managed live provider resources, Sessions and HTTP transport.
- Explicit supported OS/filesystem assumptions and what remains deferred.
- Constraints on future migrations: no CLI-handler imports in Runtime, no provider/session dependency in workflow, no implicit one-checkout roots.

## What must not be frozen prematurely

Exact public command names, JSON schema fields, package name, Git error code strings, token/heartbeat implementation, cleanup policy, initial UI widget shape or cross-platform filesystem guarantees without tests and owner approval. Distinguish design intent from an implemented production contract.
