# Plan 01 — Engine and Project Foundation

**Lifecycle: temporary implementation plan.** This is deliberately **not** the future SpecFlow specification format or an ADR. Complete tasks, verify the contract, move durable decisions into their authoritative homes, and remove this file when the temporary program ends.

**Implementation baseline:** fresh `main` when work begins; the idea dossier is [PR #50](https://github.com/dczerwinskipl/nevo-specflow/pull/50) (draft, candidate design). Reinspect merged changes rather than relying on its original 10 October baseline or treating #45 as unmerged. Existing current docs outrank `draft` ideas; architectural conflicts require a decision, not a quiet override.

## Target and independently verifiable result

A separate CLI process launched in a primary or **registered** linked Git worktree finds **one** Project Home and the correct current execution root. CLI and Runtime share the same application Engine and durable coordination state without requiring Runtime to be running. No new speculative workflow or session service is necessary to prove this boundary.

Existing seams: `packages/specflow/src/program.ts` (composition), `packages/specflow/src/project/`, `packages/specflow-runtime/src/features/specs/`, `@nevo/specflow-contracts` and existing single-artifact bundling. The public CLI currently has `init`, `start` and `auth` but no `specs` or `workflow` command; do not describe proposed commands as existing.

## Execution order, task files and review checkpoints

Each task has its own Markdown file. **Batch** means sequential tasks in one agent session; **parallel** means independent workers writing disjoint owners; **solo** means separately executed and reviewed. The task-level dependency links are executable prerequisites, not only documentation. For cross-plan ordering see the [program runbook](../README.md).

### Recommended waves

1. T01 solo (evidence)
2. T02 solo (boundary)
3. T03 solo (home)
4. T04 → T05 sequential batch `1-state-core`
5. T06 solo (composition)
6. T07 solo (acceptance)

**Batch policy:** never auto-batch a high-risk solo gate with dependent tasks; re-evaluate shared file ownership at dispatch. In particular, lock/claim, security, HTTP scopes, durability/recovery and dispatch uncertainty need an explicit review checkpoint. If a task uncovers an architecture conflict, stop dependent tasks but continue unaffected, disjoint work.

## Design decisions this plan must resolve

- **Project Home selection**: choose a concrete locator/marker and recovery diagnostic. Git common-dir is membership evidence, not an automatic SpecFlow state owner.
- **Config provenance**: operational `.nevo/config.yaml` plus `.nevo/local/config.yaml` from designated home; workspace-specific Git-tracked workflow definitions will be handled by Plan 03.
- **Local vs portable identity**: `workspaceId` is local. Existing committed `runtime.authorization` policy must not bind portable grants to that local ID. Stable `specId` and project-level capabilities are candidates; validate allowed dimensions at feature boundary.
- **Topology**: local filesystem + Git-backed project are supported first; NFS/multi-host and non-Git projects intentionally deferred.
- **Moved/deleted home**: reliably detect and fail closed, retaining repair evidence. Successful automatic relocation of home is **deferred**, not secretly marked passing.

## Verification / exit gate

- CLI from primary and registered linked checkout resolves the same Project Home/state and distinct `workspaceId`; Runtime off (P01, C10).
- Missing/ambiguous home, wrong override, independent clone and bad state fail without new empty registry (P02–P04, L07).
- Linked committed config diverges, but Runtime/CLI operational policy stays owned by home; no local `workspaceId` in portable Auth grant (P06, H10).
- Cross-process registry updates do not lose or interleave writes (L02).
- One installable CLI, independent Engine imports, and tested Windows/POSIX real Git paths.

**Not in this plan:** Spec creation, worktree provisioning, full recovery journal, managed Session, long execution claim or workflow attempt. They belong to Plans 02–05.

## Sources and handoff

- [Project Home discovery](../../project-home-discovery.md), [project/workspace context](../../project-and-workspace-context.md), [registry](../../workspace-registry-and-discovery.md), [Engine boundaries](../../engine-cli-runtime-boundaries.md), [local actors/auth](../../local-actor-and-human-gates.md).
- [ADR 0012](../../../../architecture/decisions/0012-product-package-topology-and-dependency-direction.md), [Runtime configuration](../../../../architecture/runtime/configuration.md), [CLI contract](../../../../reference/cli/nevo-specflow-contract.md), [acceptance](../../acceptance-criteria.md).

**Ready for Plan 02:** a single Engine boundary, deterministic project locator and local coordination primitive tested by independent processes. A remaining implementation choice is acceptable only if it does not change identities, actor trust or source authority.
