# E1.T04 — Workspace registry

**Temporary implementation task.** Work on branch `feature/specflow-engine-foundation`; do not create a per-task PR or treat this document as a formal Specification. The [plan overview](../README.md) owns the acceptance boundary.

## Required implementation / outcome

Establish versioned local registry identity `workspaceId -> root`, optional `specId -> workspaceId`, membership verification, unavailable/corrupt states, and atomic local read/update ports. Different clone sharing a remote must not join the local registry.

## Prerequisites

- [E1.T03](T03-project-home-resolver.md)

Original planning dependency: T03. The linked IDs above are the **executable** dependency graph; a separate spec-level gate still applies.

## Execution & batching

- Mode: **Sequential batch** `1-state-core`; the predecessor task must complete first.
- Reason: Sequential with T05 in one agent context; keep registry format stable.
- **No concurrent writes** to the same shared manifest, registry, journal, Git ref, auth/DTO contract or Runtime feature composition without explicit coordinated ownership; dependency-free alone does not imply safe parallel execution.
- In a batch, execute tasks **in order** with a checkpoint after each and stop on unexpected contract changes. This is not simultaneous execution.

## Verification evidence to attach to review

- Specific evidence: **C07/C08/C09/P04/P05**. These IDs refer to the [canonical candidate test matrix](../../../test-plan.md); where evidence is qualitative, provide precise inspected source/contract and build/import checks instead of inventing a PASS result.
- Show positive behavior and at least one meaningful failure/no-side-effect case for the changed boundary. Run relevant existing tests; report OS/Git/Node versions for actual Git/process cases.
- Report modified modules, new/changed contracts, tests run (PASS/FAIL/SKIP), unresolved risk and any changes that affect later task dependencies.
- Do not claim this task or its parent plan complete while required checks are skipped or unresolved security/lifecycle ownership remains.
