# E2.T06 — Runtime read integration

**Temporary implementation task.** Work on branch `feature/specflow-engine-foundation`; do not create a per-task PR or treat this document as a formal Specification. The [plan overview](../README.md) owns the acceptance boundary.

## Required implementation / outcome

Implement **production** Engine-backed Overview/Workspace/Document reads in `packages/specflow-runtime/src/features/specs/`, preserving existing DTOs, feature-scoped authorization, unavailable vs missing and current demo repositories **only** for explicit demo/test. No frontend fixtures in production.

**Architecture closure (15 October 2026): Task read is explicitly deferred, not silently implemented.** Engine's current `SpecificationManifest.tasks` is `readonly unknown[]`: its parser validates only the array shape. There is no accepted Task identity, readiness/transition schema or public Task read DTO. Exposing `readTasks(): Promise<unknown[]>` would leak an unvalidated storage detail. E3.T03 establishes canonical workflow/step state; E3.T09 owns the subsequent typed Task/Workflow Runtime read projection once that contract is approved. This does not block E2.T08, which must not claim Task read or workflow readiness evidence. See `packages/specflow-runtime/src/features/specs/read/engine-repository.ts` for the supported Workspace/Document ports.

## Prerequisites

- [E2.T03](T03-binding-and-discovery.md)
- [E2.T05](T05-cli-and-http-create.md)

Original planning dependency: E2.T03–T05. The linked IDs above are the **executable** dependency graph; a separate spec-level gate still applies.

## Execution & batching

- Mode: **Sequential batch** `2-read-freshness`; the predecessor task must complete first.
- Reason: Sequential with T07 in same agent context; same runtime read boundary.
- **No concurrent writes** to the same shared manifest, registry, journal, Git ref, auth/DTO contract or Runtime feature composition without explicit coordinated ownership; dependency-free alone does not imply safe parallel execution.
- In a batch, execute tasks **in order** with a checkpoint after each and stop on unexpected contract changes. This is not simultaneous execution.

## Verification evidence to attach to review

- Specific evidence: **H01/H04/H05/H08**. These IDs refer to the [canonical candidate test matrix](../../../test-plan.md); where evidence is qualitative, provide precise inspected source/contract and build/import checks instead of inventing a PASS result.
- Show positive behavior and at least one meaningful failure/no-side-effect case for the changed boundary. Run relevant existing tests; report OS/Git/Node versions for actual Git/process cases.
- Report modified modules, new/changed contracts, tests run (PASS/FAIL/SKIP), unresolved risk and any changes that affect later task dependencies.
- Do not claim this task or its parent plan complete while required checks are skipped or unresolved security/lifecycle ownership remains.
