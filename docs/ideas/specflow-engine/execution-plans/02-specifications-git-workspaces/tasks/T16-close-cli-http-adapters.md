# E2.T16 — Offline CLI and authenticated HTTP parity

**Temporary task, documentation only.** Branch feature/specflow-engine-foundation / existing PR #53. No product implementation exists merely because this plan is present. This file must be removed with the entire temporary execution-plans tree before PR merge.

## Executable prerequisites

- E2.T13 accepted
- E2.T15 accepted
- Spec capability authorization contract reviewed

Run mode: **SOLO / security review**. No parallel writes to shared Git refs, registry schemas, journal/state files, authentication capability lists or runtime composition. Re-check HEAD and approved decisions DC01–DC18 before editing code.

## Modules and ownership

packages/specflow/src/specs/command.ts for CLI; packages/specflow-runtime/src/features/specs/close/{endpoint,error-status}.ts and feature.ts for HTTP; packages/specflow-contracts/src/specs/{close,capabilities,index}.ts. No Engine Git/registry or archive commit mutation in transport. Agent and human initiate the same Engine operation; they do not manually apply its archive commit.

## Required behavior / exact acceptance

1. Add CLI specs worktree close <spec-id> and specs close <spec-id>, read-only preview/check and inspect/resume where safe. --json, --operation-id, --integrate/--no-integrate for linked Specification close, an ordinary destructive-action confirmation in UX when appropriate (not a synthetic workflow/external-writer assertion), stable nonzero exit and actionable error code, with Runtime OFF.
2. Persist git.integrationTargetBranch via project init/configuration and read only trusted Project Home policy; do not let an HTTP body/CLI flag override configured target without a distinct authorized reconfiguration. POST /api/specs/{specId}/worktree/close and POST /api/specs/{specId}/close, with read-only preview/operation status endpoints as needed. HTTP validates requests, enforces authenticated narrowly scoped CloseWorktree and CloseSpecification independently of Create, resolves canonical identity securely, and returns typed result/status.
3. Selector fields cannot grant authorization; do not leak unauthorized spec metadata, paths, branch names or journal status. No demo/fixture fallback, no unconfigured Engine writes, no fake administrative gate-bypass or quiescence-assertion fields. Avoid granting local workstation workspaceId as portable Auth scope.
4. Typed result must distinguish integrated-and-removed, locally-archived-and-retained, integration-requires-resolution, and post-effect cleanup pending. Conflict-resolution actions (self vs agent) are future UI/workflow operations, not transport flags that claim execution. Error mapping explicit/exhaustive (400/401/403/404/409/422/503; unexpected 500); public JSON result distinguishes REAL integration/cleanup pending from completed success; no fictitious exit gate or external-writer status. Runtime live reads resolve new binding/archive and invalidate refresh data.

## Required evidence

- Positive: same Engine outcome, idempotency and canonical live Overview in offline CLI and authorized HTTP
- Negative/no unintended effects: no capability, wrong scope, unresolved operation, Engine unavailable, forged destination/workspace selector yield correct safe responses with zero Git/fs/registry effect
- Report LC test IDs, test files, OS/Node/Git version for real filesystem/process work, PASS/FAIL/SKIP, modified public contracts, and an independent code-quality/recovery review. Mock-only tests do not satisfy Git/process cases.
- Checkpoint for this task: Independent authz review and HTTP schema/CLI parity tests.
- Preserve completed E2.T01–T08; avoid unrelated refactors. No Plan 03 or Session dependency.

## Required self-review corrections before T16 ACCEPT

- **Project-wide merge authorization:** Any HTTP CloseWorktree or CloseSpecification with integrateToTargetBranch=true can merge the ENTIRE source branch (code/config included). A narrowly scoped Spec-close capability is NOT adequate. Require a real, independently checked project-wide Git integration permission (or demonstrably equivalent project-wide grant) BEFORE the first mutation, including an Engine-scoped archive commit. Archive-only CloseSpecification needs only its Spec-close authorization. Full branch commit/path diff belongs in preflight/preview; protect sensitive project/config/auth changes (e.g. `.nevo/config.yaml`) with explicit authority or refusal. Test cross-scope callers and zero side effects.
- **Init config:** Current `specflow init` writes only Runtime config. T10 already owns the validated Project Home git.integrationTargetBranch parser/missing-config contract. T16 wires initial branch selection (suggest current primary checked-out branch but never assume main) plus explicit safe reconfiguration/migration UX for existing initialized configs. No accidental overwrite of committed project policy.
- **Truthful conflict outcome:** Public error/result and operation inspection must distinguish an archived-but-retained linked Specification requiring integration resolution from integrated-and-removed success. Do not promise a working agent/manual resolution UI in this slice; expose durable state and future capability seam only.
