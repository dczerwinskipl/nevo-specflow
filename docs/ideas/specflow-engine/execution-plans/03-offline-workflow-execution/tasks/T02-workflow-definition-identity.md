# E3.T02 — Workflow definition/identity

**Temporary implementation task.** Work on branch `feature/specflow-engine-foundation`; do not create a per-task PR or treat this document as a formal Specification. The [plan overview](../README.md) owns the acceptance boundary.

## Required implementation / outcome

Build declarative workflow loader and validation within Engine. Resolve definition from **target execution workspace**; pin immutable definition provenance to attempt (digest/retained content or verified Git object). Respect identity `(change, task, step, attempt)` and versioned transition semantics.

**Future compatibility only:** Keep workflow-step attempt identity independent from the number of later execution instances, Sessions or Runs. This task still proves one minimal attempt, not the deferred user-configurable multi-instance definition schema. See [deferred multi-instance design](../../../multi-instance-execution.md).

## Prerequisites

- [E3.T01](T01-legacy-fact-check.md)

Original planning dependency: T01. The linked IDs above are the **executable** dependency graph; a separate spec-level gate still applies.

## Execution & batching

- Mode: **Solo / review gate** — separate execution and result inspection.
- Reason: Version-pinned workflow definition and attempt identity are canonical state; isolate.
- **No concurrent writes** to the same shared manifest, registry, journal, Git ref, auth/DTO contract or Runtime feature composition without explicit coordinated ownership; dependency-free alone does not imply safe parallel execution.
- In a batch, execute tasks **in order** with a checkpoint after each and stop on unexpected contract changes. This is not simultaneous execution.

## Verification evidence to attach to review

- Specific evidence: **W10/FB09**. These IDs refer to the [canonical candidate test matrix](../../../test-plan.md); where evidence is qualitative, provide precise inspected source/contract and build/import checks instead of inventing a PASS result.
- Show positive behavior and at least one meaningful failure/no-side-effect case for the changed boundary. Run relevant existing tests; report OS/Git/Node versions for actual Git/process cases.
- Report modified modules, new/changed contracts, tests run (PASS/FAIL/SKIP), unresolved risk and any changes that affect later task dependencies.
- Do not claim this task or its parent plan complete while required checks are skipped or unresolved security/lifecycle ownership remains.
