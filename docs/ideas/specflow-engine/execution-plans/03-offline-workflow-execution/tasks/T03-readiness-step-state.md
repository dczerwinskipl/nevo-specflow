# E3.T03 — Readiness/step state

**Temporary implementation task.** Work on branch `feature/specflow-engine-foundation`; do not create a per-task PR or treat this document as a formal Specification. The [plan overview](../README.md) owns the acceptance boundary.

## Required implementation / outcome

Implement read-only `inspect`, readiness and blocker reporting; explicit `start` activates or resumes, `finish` completes without automatically starting the next step; enforce declared transition branch. Preserve one canonical state, not UI/status duplicates.

**Future compatibility only:** A step is the canonical transition unit; do not make the one Session/Turn that performed work its durable identity. This task implements exactly one real step start/finish, not future N instance slots, typed contribution aggregation or aggregate finalization; see [deferred multi-instance design](../../../multi-instance-execution.md).

## Prerequisites

- [E3.T02](T02-workflow-definition-identity.md)

Original planning dependency: T02. The linked IDs above are the **executable** dependency graph; a separate spec-level gate still applies.

## Execution & batching

- Mode: **Sequential batch** `3-workflow-readiness`; the predecessor task must complete first.
- Reason: Sequential with T04 after T02; one workflow kernel owner.
- **No concurrent writes** to the same shared manifest, registry, journal, Git ref, auth/DTO contract or Runtime feature composition without explicit coordinated ownership; dependency-free alone does not imply safe parallel execution.
- In a batch, execute tasks **in order** with a checkpoint after each and stop on unexpected contract changes. This is not simultaneous execution.

## Verification evidence to attach to review

- Specific evidence: **W01/W02**. These IDs refer to the [canonical candidate test matrix](../../../test-plan.md); where evidence is qualitative, provide precise inspected source/contract and build/import checks instead of inventing a PASS result.
- Show positive behavior and at least one meaningful failure/no-side-effect case for the changed boundary. Run relevant existing tests; report OS/Git/Node versions for actual Git/process cases.
- Report modified modules, new/changed contracts, tests run (PASS/FAIL/SKIP), unresolved risk and any changes that affect later task dependencies.
- Do not claim this task or its parent plan complete while required checks are skipped or unresolved security/lifecycle ownership remains.
