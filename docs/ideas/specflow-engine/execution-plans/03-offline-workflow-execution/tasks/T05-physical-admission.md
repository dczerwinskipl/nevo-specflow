# E3.T05 — Physical admission

**Temporary implementation task.** Work on branch `feature/specflow-engine-foundation`; do not create a per-task PR or treat this document as a formal Specification. The [plan overview](../README.md) owns the acceptance boundary.

## Required implementation / outcome

Derive execution effect scope (read-only enforced vs workspace writer vs Git refs). Implement short mutation guard and separate durable long-running physical workspace claim; support non-Task Spec Writer claim. A workflow attempt is **not** the claim.

**Future compatibility only:** Preserve effect-scoped admission: proven read-only execution does not monopolize a physical writer claim merely because it is agent-originated. Do not implement review-group snapshot locks or a reader/writer lease system in this task; see [deferred multi-instance design](../../../multi-instance-execution.md).

## Prerequisites

- [E3.T03](T03-readiness-step-state.md)
- [E1.T05](../../01-engine-project-foundation/tasks/T05-shared-coordination-primitives.md)

Original planning dependency: Plans 01–02, T03. The linked IDs above are the **executable** dependency graph; a separate spec-level gate still applies.

## Execution & batching

- Mode: **Solo / review gate** — separate execution and result inspection.
- Reason: Effect scoped physical admission is concurrency-critical; independent review.
- **No concurrent writes** to the same shared manifest, registry, journal, Git ref, auth/DTO contract or Runtime feature composition without explicit coordinated ownership; dependency-free alone does not imply safe parallel execution.
- In a batch, execute tasks **in order** with a checkpoint after each and stop on unexpected contract changes. This is not simultaneous execution.

## Verification evidence to attach to review

- Specific evidence: **L03/L04/W03–W05**. These IDs refer to the [canonical candidate test matrix](../../../test-plan.md); where evidence is qualitative, provide precise inspected source/contract and build/import checks instead of inventing a PASS result.
- Show positive behavior and at least one meaningful failure/no-side-effect case for the changed boundary. Run relevant existing tests; report OS/Git/Node versions for actual Git/process cases.
- Report modified modules, new/changed contracts, tests run (PASS/FAIL/SKIP), unresolved risk and any changes that affect later task dependencies.
- Do not claim this task or its parent plan complete while required checks are skipped or unresolved security/lifecycle ownership remains.
