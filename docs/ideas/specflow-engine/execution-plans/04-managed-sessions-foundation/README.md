# Plan 04 — Managed Sessions Foundation

**Lifecycle: temporary implementation plan.** Independently useful Runtime capability with a **controlled fake/mock provider**, _not_ proof that any real provider can resume or switch worktrees. Work can begin alongside Plan 03 once Plan 01's identity boundaries are sufficiently decided.

## Verifiable result

An authenticated user creates/opens a provider-backed **test** Session in a fixed, verified project checkout context; invokes a Turn; Runtime persists canonical `Session -> Turn -> Work -> ToolAction`; receives ordered events and optional interaction requests; restarts; then reads a truthful recovered Session view. All identity, attention/readiness and Turn concurrency rules come from Runtime, not UI heuristics.

Actual repository evidence: `packages/specflow-runtime/src/features/sessions/feature.ts` currently only registers Session authorization capabilities; `packages/specflow-contracts/src/sessions/` contains capabilities, not the full execution model. No real Session management API should be assumed already implemented. Reuse current [AI architecture](../../../../architecture/ai/canonical-session-turn-work.md).

## Execution order, task files and review checkpoints

Each task has its own Markdown file. **Batch** means sequential tasks in one agent session; **parallel** means independent workers writing disjoint owners; **solo** means separately executed and reviewed. The task-level dependency links are executable prerequisites, not only documentation. For cross-plan ordering see the [program runbook](../README.md).

### Recommended waves

1. T01 solo (discovery)
2. T02 solo (identity/DTO contract)
3. **T03 ∥ T04** parallel group `4-session-internals` (separate code ownership)
4. T05 solo (coordinator integration)
5. T06 → T07 sequential batch `4-runtime-surface`
6. T08 solo (acceptance)

**Batch policy:** never auto-batch a high-risk solo gate with dependent tasks; re-evaluate shared file ownership at dispatch. In particular, lock/claim, security, HTTP scopes, durability/recovery and dispatch uncertainty need an explicit review checkpoint. If a task uncovers an architecture conflict, stop dependent tasks but continue unaffected, disjoint work.

## Deliberately no Engine claim in this foundation

A standalone Session can exist without Task, workflow or Engine writer claim **only if the mock execution is enforced read-only / no real filesystem mutations**. Provider dispatch that could actually write code is blocked until Plan 05 integrates Engine admission. A conversational Turn is not secretly a workflow attempt.

Session associations with a Spec/Task are optional scoped product metadata and must be authorized, not used as implicit workflow progression. The Runtime Session service owns presentation-level semantic readiness; the UI cannot guess statuses from provider event strings.

## Exit gate

- Pass **S01** on real persistence and Runtime HTTP: durable `sessionId`, Turn/Work ordering and reload, truly read-only mock conversation.
- Demonstrate one-active-turn admission, idempotent duplicate Turn request, safe terminal immutability, correct interaction validity after restart/cancel and scoped Session read.
- Production wiring uses feature-owned source, not Storybook/demo fixtures; if provider is absent in production, report unsupported/unavailable honestly.
- Dependency/import review: Engine does not import Sessions, provider adapters, UI or Runtime.

This foundation **does not claim SI03–SI08**, which require Plan 05 and broader mock-provider execution tests.

## Exclusions with explicit future owner

No real Claude/Codex/Antigravity adapter, native provider resume, changing provider `cwd` across worktrees, Session migration after spec rebind, cross-worktree live Session moves, native history import, full transcript cloning or production provider credential manager. These become later adapter-specific plans after their actual capabilities can be verified.

## Sources and handoff

**Ready for Plan 05:** stable product and provider-correlated identities, persisted Turn lifecycle, deterministic mock driver, authorized read model and no hidden mutation without Engine admission.
