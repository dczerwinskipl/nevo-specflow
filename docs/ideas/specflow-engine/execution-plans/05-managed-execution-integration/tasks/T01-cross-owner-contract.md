# E5.T01 — Cross-owner contract

**Temporary implementation task.** Work on branch `feature/specflow-engine-foundation`; do not create a per-task PR or treat this document as a formal Specification. The [plan overview](../README.md) owns the acceptance boundary.

## Required implementation / outcome

Inspect Engine admission/claim/attempt APIs from Plan 03 and Runtime Turn/Session persistence from Plan 04. Define explicit intent/receipt shapes and resource ownership. `sessionId`, `turnId`, `invocationId`, `executionId`, `workspaceId`, `workflowAttemptRef`, and `ProviderSessionRef` stay distinct.

## Prerequisites

- [E3.T10](../../03-offline-workflow-execution/tasks/T10-process-restart-tests.md)
- [E4.T08](../../04-managed-sessions-foundation/tasks/T08-lifecycle-security-tests.md)

Original planning dependency: Plans 03 & 04. The linked IDs above are the **executable** dependency graph; a separate spec-level gate still applies.

## Execution & batching

- Mode: **Solo / review gate** — separate execution and result inspection.
- Reason: Cross-owner Engine/Runtime identity handshake requires a review before mutations.
- **No concurrent writes** to the same shared manifest, registry, journal, Git ref, auth/DTO contract or Runtime feature composition without explicit coordinated ownership; dependency-free alone does not imply safe parallel execution.
- In a batch, execute tasks **in order** with a checkpoint after each and stop on unexpected contract changes. This is not simultaneous execution.

## Verification evidence to attach to review

- Specific evidence: **S02; identities and ownership matrix**. These IDs refer to the [canonical candidate test matrix](../../../test-plan.md); where evidence is qualitative, provide precise inspected source/contract and build/import checks instead of inventing a PASS result.
- Show positive behavior and at least one meaningful failure/no-side-effect case for the changed boundary. Run relevant existing tests; report OS/Git/Node versions for actual Git/process cases.
- Report modified modules, new/changed contracts, tests run (PASS/FAIL/SKIP), unresolved risk and any changes that affect later task dependencies.
- Do not claim this task or its parent plan complete while required checks are skipped or unresolved security/lifecycle ownership remains.
