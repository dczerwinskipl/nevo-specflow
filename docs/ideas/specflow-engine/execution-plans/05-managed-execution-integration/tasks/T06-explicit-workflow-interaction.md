# E5.T06 — Explicit workflow interaction

**Temporary implementation task.** Work on branch `feature/specflow-engine-foundation`; do not create a per-task PR or treat this document as a formal Specification. The [plan overview](../README.md) owns the acceptance boundary.

## Required implementation / outcome

Link one managed writable Turn to an actual Workflow attempt, then call explicit Engine `step finish` after passing declared gates; verify no hidden transition on Turn settlement. Also show a standalone truly read-only Turn with no workflow/claim.

**Future compatibility only:** Prove the current single-instance `step finish` changes canonical workflow state exactly once. Do not assume provider Turn termination is finalization and do not hardwire the concept that there can never be several evidence-producing runs for one step. The agent-facing contribution `finish` versus a dedicated instance-submit command remains an open decision in the [idea](../../../multi-instance-execution.md); current one-instance semantics do not change.

## Prerequisites

- [E5.T05](T05-turn-claim-settlement.md)

Original planning dependency: T05. The linked IDs above are the **executable** dependency graph; a separate spec-level gate still applies.

## Execution & batching

- Mode: **Solo / review gate** — separate execution and result inspection.
- Reason: Only explicit finish advances workflow; owner reviews transition proof.
- **No concurrent writes** to the same shared manifest, registry, journal, Git ref, auth/DTO contract or Runtime feature composition without explicit coordinated ownership; dependency-free alone does not imply safe parallel execution.
- In a batch, execute tasks **in order** with a checkpoint after each and stop on unexpected contract changes. This is not simultaneous execution.

## Verification evidence to attach to review

- Specific evidence: **S02/S03**. These IDs refer to the [canonical candidate test matrix](../../../test-plan.md); where evidence is qualitative, provide precise inspected source/contract and build/import checks instead of inventing a PASS result.
- Show positive behavior and at least one meaningful failure/no-side-effect case for the changed boundary. Run relevant existing tests; report OS/Git/Node versions for actual Git/process cases.
- Report modified modules, new/changed contracts, tests run (PASS/FAIL/SKIP), unresolved risk and any changes that affect later task dependencies.
- Do not claim this task or its parent plan complete while required checks are skipped or unresolved security/lifecycle ownership remains.
