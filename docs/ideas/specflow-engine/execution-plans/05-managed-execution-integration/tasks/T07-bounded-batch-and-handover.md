# E5.T07 — Bounded batch and handover

**Temporary implementation task.** Work on branch `feature/specflow-engine-foundation`; do not create a per-task PR or treat this document as a formal Specification. The [plan overview](../README.md) owns the acceptance boundary.

## Required implementation / outcome

Support minimal **explicit** ordered set of Task attempts and new successor Session intent/context, preserving per-Task state and current claim. Never infer a Task from historical Session associations; no automatic reviewer spawning or claim transfer without settlement.

**Scope guard:** This batch covers several **different Task attempts** from one execution scope. It is not multiple independent executions of the **same** user-defined step attempt, and must not allocate step-instance slots, waive required results or aggregate outputs. Preserve correlation boundaries for the [future multi-instance plan](../../../multi-instance-plan/README.md).

## Prerequisites

- [E5.T05](T05-turn-claim-settlement.md)
- [E5.T06](T06-explicit-workflow-interaction.md)

Original planning dependency: T05–T06. The linked IDs above are the **executable** dependency graph; a separate spec-level gate still applies.

## Execution & batching

- Mode: **Solo / review gate** — separate execution and result inspection.
- Reason: Batch/handover semantics must not inherit implicit task/claim; isolate.
- **No concurrent writes** to the same shared manifest, registry, journal, Git ref, auth/DTO contract or Runtime feature composition without explicit coordinated ownership; dependency-free alone does not imply safe parallel execution.
- In a batch, execute tasks **in order** with a checkpoint after each and stop on unexpected contract changes. This is not simultaneous execution.

## Verification evidence to attach to review

- Specific evidence: **S04/S05**. These IDs refer to the [canonical candidate test matrix](../../../test-plan.md); where evidence is qualitative, provide precise inspected source/contract and build/import checks instead of inventing a PASS result.
- Show positive behavior and at least one meaningful failure/no-side-effect case for the changed boundary. Run relevant existing tests; report OS/Git/Node versions for actual Git/process cases.
- Report modified modules, new/changed contracts, tests run (PASS/FAIL/SKIP), unresolved risk and any changes that affect later task dependencies.
- Do not claim this task or its parent plan complete while required checks are skipped or unresolved security/lifecycle ownership remains.
