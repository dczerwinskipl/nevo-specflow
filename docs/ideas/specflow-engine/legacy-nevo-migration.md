# Legacy Nevo migration map

## Scope and sequencing

Legacy `dczerwinskipl/nevo` includes both older workflow and newer deterministic execution. **Only migrate the deterministic workflow path**; do not reintroduce a selectable legacy mode. Architectural constraints must be established and demonstrated by the Specs creation slice before porting a large subsystem. Reinspect actual source/HEAD before every migration; this is a map, not an exhaustive copied-file inventory.

## Candidate module map

| Old path | New owner | What to preserve | What to change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tools/specs.mjs` | `@nevo/specflow` CLI composition + feature-owned adapters | Human/agent command semantics and stable machine output | No application logic in root Commander, no imports of Runtime private Session binding |
| `tools/specs/store.mjs`, `identity.mjs`, `validation.mjs`, `indexes.mjs` | Engine Specs capability | Stable spec identity, validation, manifests, deterministic indexes | Explicit Project/Workspace context, no module-relative hardcoded ROOT |
| `tools/specs/generate/**`, `query.mjs`, `context.mjs` | Engine Specs/read and context operations | Deterministic specification query/context preparation | No global current cwd, per-workspace cache/version |
| `tools/specs/workflow/definitions/**`, `contracts.mjs`, `registry.mjs` | Engine Workflow | Declarative definition and action/gate contracts | No Runtime/CLI import or hidden global provider registry |
| `tools/specs/workflow/start-operation.mjs`, `finish-operation.mjs`, `step-runner.mjs` | Engine Workflow | Explicit start/finish, attempt/evidence identity, replay | Use Engine journal/claim ports and per-workspace discovery |
| `tools/specs/workflow/readiness-policy.mjs`, `step-context.mjs` | Engine Workflow | Nonmutating inspect, readiness, workflow-owned paths | Context constructed from project + workspace; no agent session required |
| `tools/specs/workflow/workspace-writer.mjs`, `workspace-request.mjs` | Engine coordination | Physical-worktree ownership, atomic compare-and-set, conflict guards | Distinguish short lock, external claim, Runtime-managed turn; review queue necessity rather than copy FIFO |
| `tools/specs/workflow/operation-record.mjs`, `cli-workspace-execution.mjs` | Engine local persistence | Durable recovery records | Central project registry/journal partitioned by workspace; versioned schemas |
| `tools/specs/workflow/actions/commit-and-push.mjs` | Engine Workflow action consuming Git capability | Fail-closed Git facts, scoped commit checks | Avoid direct cwd assumptions and implicit finalize checkout; verify action idempotency |
| `tools/specs/approve/**`, `start/**`, `complete/**`, `verify/**`, `finalize/**` | Review against deterministic Engine operations | Relevant validation/PR evidence and user actions | Do not port legacy lifecycle transitions as a second workflow mode |
| `tools/lib/git.mjs` | Engine Git adapter | Safe root-aware Git invocations and useful diff/status parsing | Narrow capability ports and error taxonomy; test worktree-specific behavior |
| `tools/dashboard/server/specs/routes.mjs` | Runtime Specs HTTP adapter | Existing route shapes where still relevant | No direct mutation orchestration, Git, lock or finish journaling in handler |
| `tools/dashboard/server/specs/data.mjs`, `service.mjs` | Engine query + Runtime read projections | Contextual read model/aggregations | Separate canonical reads from Session overlays and transport DTO |
| `tools/dashboard/server/specs/watcher.mjs`, `events.mjs` | Runtime observation/SSE | Scoped filesystem invalidation | Watch registered roots, handle missing/replaced worktree, no source authority |
| `tools/dashboard/server/ai/providers/**` | Runtime providers | Provider protocol adapters, capability/error evidence | Session-safe workspace identity; no fixed global cwd if target worktree differs |
| `tools/dashboard/server/ai/sessions/**` | Runtime Sessions + feature-bound bindings | Canonical Session/Turn/Work for managed calls | Do not require managed Session for external Engine operation |
| `tools/dashboard/server/ai/orchestration/admission.mjs` | Split: Engine admission and Runtime provider/turn coordination | Safety of physical writer admission and turn settlement | Remove requirement for Runtime-managed session to authorize offline workflow |
| `tools/dashboard/server/infrastructure/operation-runtime.mjs` | Runtime live operation/SSE projection | Progress streaming semantics | Engine durable operation journal is independent authority |
| `tools/docs/**` and agent skill wrappers | Repo tooling/agent adapters as applicable | Deterministic doc discovery and vendor-neutral command usage | Do not conflate repository tooling with distributed product Engine |

## Special caution: legacy finalize

Old `tools/specs/finalize/operation.mjs` explicitly checks out base branch, commits archive, merges PR and deletes branches. That sequence assumes a single mutable checkout and is not safe in a linked worktree. Future migration must separate: workflow verification, source integration into target ref, archive propagation, and optional cleanup of managed worktree. The created Specification's only archived copy cannot be left solely on a deleted worktree.

## Special caution: legacy CLI binding and session semantics

Old `tools/specs.mjs` and `tools/specs/agent-session.mjs` directly import `tools/dashboard/server/ai/sessions/binding-service.mjs`. Avoid reversing this import in SpecFlow. External agent CLI can progress workflow without any Runtime-managed provider state. Attaching an unmanaged external provider session is a separate opt-in feature; never implicitly fabricate Runtime Turns from CLI command events.

## Migration agent checklist

1. Read current `main` and accepted ADRs, then consult relevant docs under this **draft** ideas dossier as candidate guidance.
2. Inspect legacy deterministic implementation + tests and classify each part as domain operation, adapter, persistence, observer, or provider lifecycle; identify Runtime-only dependencies.
3. Identify all ambient `ROOT`, `process.cwd()`, mutable globals and cross-layer imports.
4. Locate the future Engine-owned use case and ports; expose the same operation to CLI and HTTP without duplicated transition logic.
5. Make per-workspace/physical-lock semantics explicit. For every mutation, add competing-process tests and failure/restart recovery.
6. Preserve provider-specific behavior only behind Runtime adapters; apply existing `docs/ideas/specflow-runtime/ai-adapters/` hardening guidance.
7. Include negative tests for no Runtime, stale claim, missing worktree, wrong actor and commit scope.
8. Do not import or publish `tools/*` internal code as product API.
9. Update normative docs/ADRs **after** the proof and explicit owner approval, not as a side effect of copying code.

## Interface constraints to enforce in CI

- Engine -> Runtime/CLI/Fastify/Commander/UI imports forbidden.
- Runtime/feature endpoint -> CLI handlers forbidden.
- UI -> Runtime private TS or Engine imports forbidden.
- Production UI fixture imports forbidden.
- Capability feature public entrypoints mediate cross-feature use.
- Only product composition root packages the final single npm artifact.

## Explicit deferred work

Full Task Planner, provider parity, batch protocol, PR merge and archived lifecycle, application-level batching/caching optimization, distributed/multi-host filesystem, multi-project selection and externally attached provider Sessions are follow-on tasks. Preserve their constraints here, but do not block the narrow creation proof with full feature delivery.
