# Project and Workspace context

## Separate identities

- **Specification identity (`specId`)**: durable, committed domain identity; remains stable across branch/path changes.
- **Logical project**: one SpecFlow installation/configuration scope. The local coordination home may be different from the current Git checkout.
- **Workspace (`workspaceId`)**: locally stable handle for an execution root; path is a mutable attribute, not identity.
- **Git repository identity**: verified shared Git common directory/remote metadata; it is not a spec identifier. Do not use remote URL alone (forks, multiple clones, no remote).
- **Execution identity**: separate operation/claim ID for admission; not a Session ID.

A project can have one primary checkout and zero or more registered linked worktrees. Multiple independent clones of the same remote need not share local Runtime state.

Candidate representation:

```ts
type ProjectContext = {
  projectId: string;
  projectRoot: string;  // known local coordination home
  stateRoot: string;    // explicit ignored state location
};
type WorkspaceContext = {
  workspaceId: string;
  root: string;         // verified absolute canonical filesystem root
  kind: 'primary' | 'linked';
  git?: { commonDir: string; branch?: string };
};
type SpecContext = { project: ProjectContext; workspace: WorkspaceContext; specId: string };
```

Avoid injecting this entire object into every small function. Resolve once at the invocation boundary; application operations consume relevant capabilities/ports.

## Discovery from any current directory

1. Resolve real absolute filesystem path and nearest Git checkout root where Git is in use. Distinguish primary checkout, linked checkout and bare repository.
2. Inspect Git's common-dir/worktree metadata via Git commands, not by concatenating `.git/` assumptions. Linked checkout `.git` is often a file.
3. Locate the validated configured SpecFlow project/home for that Git repository. The exact bootstrap mechanism is **undecided**: enumerate linked worktrees and confirm one designated home, or an explicit `--project`/environment-assisted locator with validation; a local non-Git discovery mode is deferred.
4. Resolve the central local registry and `workspaceId`; ensure recorded roots still refer to the same Git repository, not a symlink/substitution to an unrelated location.
5. Fail clearly when zero or multiple candidate homes exist. Never silently treat an arbitrary linked checkout as a second independent project.

Git's `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` alone returns the *current checkout*, not the project's coordination home. This is a concrete limitation of `packages/specflow/src/project/layout.ts` on main.

## Open design: home discovery and moves

Git shared metadata is useful for membership proofs but does not by itself define who owns SpecFlow's local state. Avoid writing private product state into Git internals without an explicit portability/ownership decision. Document what happens when the designated home checkout moves, is deleted, or is no longer checked out at `main`. A robust PoC must choose one tested strategy; do not claim this is solved by `git worktree list` alone.

## Path safety and isolation

Resolve/canonicalize roots; verify parent boundaries, reserved destinations, symlinks, unexpected nested repositories, duplicate real paths and branch checkout constraints before creating or deleting. File API paths must be bounded to the resolved workspace and prohibit traversal via document IDs. A path's existence alone cannot authorize cleanup or serving its files.

## Cross-workspace resources

State authority and cache location are separate. Candidate: a central registry/journal under the project's ignored `.nevo/local/state/`, partitioned by `workspaceId`. Physical lock directories may be per-workspace; all participants need the same deterministic lock address, even when invoked from a linked checkout. Do not mix an Engine journal with Runtime-only provider transcripts merely because both are stored under `.nevo/local/state/`.

## Verification focus

- Resolve same `projectId` and registry from primary and managed linked worktrees.
- Distinguish another independent clone from a registered checkout.
- Reject relative/path collisions and escaped/symlinked destinations.
- Move or remove a worktree: report repairable state without selecting an unrelated checkout.
- Relocation policy must explicitly account for native-provider Session compatibility before reusing a managed session.
