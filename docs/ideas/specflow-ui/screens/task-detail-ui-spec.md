# Task Detail UI spec

## 1. Purpose and ownership

Task Detail answers within seconds:

- What is this Task?
- Why is it in this state?
- Does it need me?
- What evidence should I inspect?
- What deterministic action is available?

Task detail is normally a contextual Secondary of Specification, or pushed detail on narrow layouts.

It does not own global Specification navigation, Full Session layout, or raw provider/runtime payloads.

## 2. User use cases

- Inspect Task intent/acceptance criteria.
- Understand why review/approval/remediation is required.
- Start/continue an available deterministic action.
- Review Task-specific evidence and shared artifacts.
- Distinguish current execution from historical/related Sessions.
- Open a related Session without losing Task context.
- Inspect changes/verification/Handover.
- Recover from or inspect an execution issue.

## 3. Entry and navigation

Entry:
- Task row from Specification;
- concrete Task signal from Specs Overview after routing to the owning Specification;
- Session Context -> Task detail.

Task Detail is local Secondary/pushed-detail state. It is not a standalone URL/deep-link contract.

Wide/Compact:
- Specification or Session remains Primary;
- Task occupies Secondary.

Narrow:
- Task replaces visible Primary context as pushed detail;
- Back returns to originating Specification/Session context.

The same Task detail composition should work in either parent context without changing Task semantics.

## 4. Data source / read-model ownership

Backend/application owns:

- Task identity/title/intent reference;
- semantic workflow state;
- per-action readiness/reason;
- current execution membership;
- dependencies/blockers;
- review/evidence/artifact references;
- current/historical related Sessions;
- continue/resume/recovery projection.

Frontend may order evidence according to the current decision but must not invent missing verdicts,
workflow state, or execution membership.

## 5. API availability / migration status

| Need | New SpecFlow | Legacy Nevo | Direction |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task identity/status/dependencies | **missing** | **legacy-available** in \`GET /api/dashboard\`, \`.../task-statuses\`, manifest | Preserve factual metadata; replace legacy universal lifecycle semantics. |
| Task document/body | **missing** | **legacy-available** via \`GET /api/specs/:source/:slug/content/:docId\` | Strong migration candidate. |
| Per-action readiness/workflow projection | **missing** | **legacy-available** via \`GET /api/specs/active/:slug/actions\` | Preserve server-owned readiness and workflow projection. |
| Human review command | **missing** | **legacy-available** via \`POST /api/specs/:slug/tasks/:taskId/workflow/human-decision\` | Preserve explicit command behavior. |
| Related Sessions | **missing** | **legacy-available** via \`GET /api/agent-sessions?specId=...&taskId=...\` | Keep association separate from current execution. |
| Current execution membership / batch context | **missing** | partial legacy evidence only | Add authoritative current-execution projection. |
| Handover/artifact/change/verification summary | **missing** | partial scattered legacy evidence | Add explicit references/read model; do not invent one generic Attachments bucket. |
| Resume vs recovery | **missing** | deterministic legacy flow has behavior/evidence, not one clean Task detail DTO | Add stable application projection. |


### Legacy field evidence

Legacy Task/list projections already expose:

~~~text
SpecificationTask
  id
  title
  status
  stage
  order
  dependsOn[]
  blockedBy[]
  ready
  terminal
  file

SpecificationTaskActionGate
  action
  enabled
  reason
  availableActions?
  status?
  currentStep?
  attempt?
  workflowState?
~~~

Legacy Task document reads also provide:

~~~text
id
docId
kind
title
path
available
markdown
status
order
dependsOn[]
~~~

Migrate factual identity/order/dependency/document fields and server-owned action facts.

Do not preserve \`ready\`, \`terminal\`, or legacy \`stage\` as sufficient new-UI semantics.
\`attention\`, \`currentExecutions[]\`, typed \`evidence[]\`, and \`continuation\` are new projections.

### Proposed Task read API

Illustrative:

~~~text
GET /api/specs/:specId/tasks/:taskId
~~~

Response:

~~~text
{
  revision,
  updatedAt,
  task: {
    id,
    specId,
    title,
    order?,
    intent: {
      summary?,
      documentRef?,
      acceptanceCriteria?,
      constraints?,
      dependencies[]
    },
    workflow: {
      semanticStatus,
      currentStep?,
      attempt?,
      state?,
      reason?,
      actions: [
        { id, label, available, reason?, confirmation? }
      ]
    },
    attention?: {
      kind,
      label,
      reason,
      decisionType?
    },
    currentExecutions: [
      {
        sessionId,
        agentRole,
        taskIds[],
        currentActivity?,
        startedAt?
      }
    ],
    evidence: [
      {
        id,
        kind,
        title,
        summary?,
        relevance,
        status?,
        target,
        sharedTaskIds?,
        updatedAt?
      }
    ],
    sessions: [
      {
        id,
        title?,
        relation: "current" | "historical" | "contextual",
        provider?,
        archetype?,
        agentRole?,
        batchId?,
        taskIds[],
        workflowStep?,
        attempt?,
        lastActivityAt?
      }
    ],
    sessionHistory: {
      hasMore,
      total?
    },
    continuation?: {
      kind: "none" | "continue" | "remediation" | "recovery",
      reason,
      actionId?
    }
  }
}
~~~

Suggested commands:

~~~text
POST /api/specs/:specId/tasks/:taskId/actions/:actionId
POST /api/specs/:specId/tasks/:taskId/decisions
~~~

Decision body example:

~~~text
{ decision: "approve" | "request-changes", feedback? }
~~~

Field coverage notes:

- `revision/updatedAt` protect Task detail from stale out-of-order refreshes.
- `workflow.actions[]` is the legal-action source; `semanticStatus` is descriptive, not command
  authorization.
- `currentExecutions[]` is plural deliberately so read-only review/other concurrent execution
  contexts are not silently lost.
- `evidence.sharedTaskIds[]` preserves multi-Task artifacts without cloning them as fake
  Task-specific reports.
- `sessions[].relation` distinguishes contextual/history from actual current execution.
- provider/archetype/batch/workflow metadata is factual orientation only; it does not prove which
  Session completed a transition unless workflow/history evidence references that Session.
- `sessionHistory.hasMore` supports a bounded useful list plus Show all without assuming Session
  history is always small.
- a future evidence/session reference may add a Turn anchor without changing Session identity.
- `continuation.kind` makes continue/remediation/recovery mutually explicit in the projection.

Behavior:

- server validates legal action at command time;
- stale UI readiness does not authorize a command;
- successful command returns operation/result identity and new projection can be fetched/streamed;
- Task terminal status is not inferred from terminal Turn;
- each \`currentExecutions[].taskIds\` may contain several Tasks;
- evidence entries may point to shared multi-Task artifacts.

## 6. Information hierarchy

1. Task identity/title.
2. decision/current state + human-readable reason.
3. available deterministic action.
4. Task intent/acceptance criteria.
5. decision-relevant readable evidence.
6. current execution plus several relevant Sessions/history.
7. deep technical/history detail.

Active/current Session is visually distinguishable from historical/contextual Sessions. Session
labels use facts such as provider, archetype/role, batch/scope, step/attempt when available; they do
not infer that an archetype alone proves completion of a review/implementation stage.
## 7. Pseudo-layout

No Card per section.
## 8. Screen anatomy

- header: Task id/title + workflow meaning + Close/Back;
- decision state and action;
- Task intent;
- readable decision evidence;
- current execution;
- related Session list with active/current emphasis and bounded history;
- Show all when Session history exceeds the normal visible budget;
- deep inspection.

Optional sections disappear when unavailable.
## 9. Responsive contract

Wide/Compact:
- Secondary alongside parent Primary;
- Task owns its own header/actions.

Narrow:
- pushed Task surface;
- Back to parent;
- same evidence/action order;
- action may use sticky placement only if it does not obscure evidence/composer-like content.

## 10. Interaction flows

### Review
Review-required -> inspect evidence -> deliberate Review/decide -> workflow-owned decision controls.

### Ready
Ready -> understand what Start does -> Start -> authoritative validation/dispatch.

### Current execution / Session history
Show authoritative current execution separately from related history.

Opening a Session:
- Wide -> Floating Session for conversation access, with Full Session available;
- Compact/Narrow -> Full Session directly.

A workflow/history entry that references a Session opens that Session. Do not insert a synthetic
"proof details" page. A future Turn anchor may scroll/open the exact completion Turn.

### Evidence
Handover/verification/artifact/change reference -> same Secondary local stack -> Back returns to Task.
Artifacts are read targets; workflow Human Step owns any approve/reject mutation.

### Resume
Safe settled execution + legal work remains -> Continue.

### Recovery
Ambiguous durable operation -> Inspect recovery -> authoritative recovery action. Do not label it
ordinary Continue.
## 11. States

- ready;
- current execution;
- human review;
- owner decision;
- operation-specific issue/blocker;
- quiet/no immediate action;
- resume/continue;
- remediation;
- recovery required;
- archived/read-only;
- evidence unavailable.


## 12. Data loading, events, and Refresh

This screen inherits
[Data loading, refresh, batching, and eventing](../data-loading-refresh-and-eventing.md).

Task state, legal actions, attention, continuation/recovery, and current execution must come from one
coherent Task projection/revision because the user interprets them together.

Large evidence bodies remain lazy:

- Task document body;
- review report;
- Handover;
- diff/change detail;
- verification/raw logs;
- historical Session detail.

### Event updates

When a workflow operation changes Task state, update/invalidate:

- this Task projection;
- the parent Specification steering projection.

Do not invalidate unrelated Tasks' heavy evidence.

A burst of progress events may update a lightweight current-execution summary, but should be
coalesced according to the shared event rules.

### Refresh

Task Detail does not need a prominent standalone Refresh button when parent/live invalidation is
healthy.

If exposed in the Task overflow for diagnostics/manual recovery, it refreshes **only the Task
projection**.

An opened evidence detail refreshes separately if that resource has its own revision/stale state.

Do not make Task Refresh refetch every related Session, document, and diff.

The detailed decision/evidence composition is defined in
[Task decision and evidence UI spec](../components/task-decision-evidence-ui-spec.md).

## 13. Component / composition map

| Need | Composition |
| --- | --- |
| Secondary shell | AppWorkspace runtime Secondary |
| Header | WorkspaceHeader |
| Task prose | Typography / MarkdownDocument |
| Decision summary | product composition; Alert only when stronger containment is justified |
| Evidence disclosure | Collapsible / rows / links |
| Chronological history | Timeline |
| Status | StatusIndicator/Badge sparingly |
| Actions | Button/Menu/AlertDialog when confirmation needed |
| Session entry | product conversation target + direct Full Session action |
| File/change/evidence detail | replace current Task Secondary via local detail stack |

## 14. Visual/token contract

- normal surface neutral;
- title: \`text-content-primary\`;
- explanatory prose: \`text-content-secondary\`;
- metadata: \`text-content-muted\`;
- separators subtle;
- attention/recovery semantic tones only where meaning requires;
- ready action uses normal action hierarchy, not warning colors;
- review evidence stays neutral unless finding severity itself is semantic.

## 15. Local containment rules

- no Card per evidence type;
- no Card around Task intent;
- no Card around entire Task detail;
- stronger contained state may be used for one exceptional attention/recovery block;
- shared review/Handover artifacts can be independently contained only if they function as distinct
  selectable objects;
- nested containment is exceptional.

## 16. Accessibility/focus

- opening Task focuses Task heading or first meaningful context;
- Back/Close restores focus to originating row/signal;
- action reason is readable without hover;
- collapsed evidence has clear accessible labels/state;
- statuses never color-only;
- confirmation dialogs name the Task/action clearly.

## 17. Storybook scenarios

- ready-to-start;
- current single Task;
- current batch;
- review required;
- waiting dependency;
- remediation available;
- continue/resume;
- recovery required;
- shared review artifact;
- several related Sessions with one active;
- long Session history with Show all;
- Session metadata without inferred role completion;
- no optional evidence;
- narrow pushed detail.
## 18. Acceptance criteria

- state/reason understood before mutation;
- evidence is directly reachable and returns through the local Secondary stack;
- artifacts/documents are readable without acquiring generic mutation buttons;
- current execution is authoritative and batch-aware;
- Session association is not execution proof;
- multiple useful Session history entries are visible without flooding pathological history;
- active/current Session is easy to find;
- clicking a referenced Session opens that Session directly;
- terminal Turn does not imply Task complete;
- linear detail remains borderless-first.
## 19. Open questions

- canonical Handover/artifact references;
- exact initial change/diff inspection contract;
- exact workflow action identifiers in new model;
- exact review decision variants defined by configured Human Steps;
- exact default visible Session-history count (design around a small handful, not a hard domain cap);
- future Turn-anchor shape for workflow/history -> Session navigation.
