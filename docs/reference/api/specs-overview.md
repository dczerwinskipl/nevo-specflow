# Specs Overview HTTP API

`GET /api/specs/overview?collection=current|archive` reads one Specs Overview collection.
Omitted `collection` defaults to `current`. Unsupported values and additional query fields
return `400`.

The response schema is owned by `@nevo/specflow-contracts/specs/overview`.

## Current

Current is the operational read model:

```ts
{
  revision: string;
  collection: 'current';
  sections: ('requires-attention' | 'active' | 'ready' | 'draft')[];
  items: CurrentSpecOverviewItem[];
}
```

Each item has one backend-owned `classification`:

```ts
{ section: 'requires-attention', reason?, count? }
{ section: 'active' }
{ section: 'ready' }
{ section: 'draft' }
```

The section list is ordered, and `classification` is the single authoritative top-level
classification for each Current item.

Current classification precedence is:

```text
requires-attention > active > ready > draft
```

- **Requires attention**: an authoritative human-attention signal exists. A known semantic reason
  such as input, decision, review, blocked, or approval is included when available; the reason is
  not required for the signal to remain human-blocking.
- **Active**: no higher-priority attention exists and at least one current execution exists.
- **Ready**: no attention or execution exists and the Spec is ready for work.
- **Draft**: the Spec is still being prepared.

Signals and current executions remain available as bounded evidence. Consumers do not reclassify a
Spec from raw signals.

Project configuration may choose and order Current sections:

```yaml
specs:
  overview:
    current:
      sections:
        - requires-attention
        - active
        - ready
        - draft
```

Omitted configuration uses the order above. Duplicate or unknown section ids are rejected.

## Archive

Archive is a separate historical read model:

```ts
{
  revision: string;
  collection: 'archive';
  items: ArchivedSpecOverviewItem[];
}
```

Archive has no Current sections, classification, signals, or current executions. Historical items
may expose authoritative `completedAt` and `archivedAt` timestamps. Consumers must not invent
Current state for archived Specs.

## Repository boundary

The `SpecsOverviewRepository` port is defined in
`features/specs/overview/repository/read-repository.ts`. It does not return HTTP DTOs. Its
`repository/model.ts` records are internal read facts and evidence used by Overview operations.
For Current, facts such as `readyForWork`, attention signals, and current executions are mapped
through `classifyCurrentSpec()`; the repository does not persist or return the final
`classification`.

Current and Archive are read independently:

```ts
readCurrent();
readArchive();
```

The Overview use cases then apply authorization, Current classification where applicable, and
mapping to the public transport contract. The current fixed catalogue is a sample `SpecsOverviewRepository` adapter,
not a property of the public API, so responses do not expose a `sample` field.

## Access

When authentication is required, a request without a valid browser session returns `401`:

```json
{ "error": "authentication_required" }
```

An authenticated subject with no `spec.view` capability in any assigned scope receives `403`:

```json
{ "error": "forbidden" }
```

A subject that possesses `spec.view` in at least one scope may enter the collection. Rows are then
filtered independently using the server-owned target scope:

```ts
{
  specId: item.id;
}
```

Therefore a scoped subject may legitimately receive `200` with an empty `items` list when none of
the Specs visible to that subject belong to the requested Current/Archive collection.

The client does not provide authorization scope. Runtime derives the per-row scope from the
authoritative Spec identifier.

Trusted-local mode keeps the same authorization semantics. If access control is disabled, registered
capabilities are available. If a local subject is configured, its assignments are evaluated normally.

Successful and authorization-denied responses use `Cache-Control: no-store`.

## UI handling

The UI treats `current` and `archive` as distinct projections while sharing one collection
switcher and one HTTP source.

Current renders the ordered `sections`; Archive renders a flat historical list. Search filters the
selected projection without changing backend classification or archive lifecycle facts.

A `401` re-enters the existing authentication flow, `403` maps to the standalone access-denied
surface, and network/server failures remain retryable Runtime-unavailable states.
