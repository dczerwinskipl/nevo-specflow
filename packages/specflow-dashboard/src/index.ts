// It deliberately does NOT start an HTTP server, load React/Vite, or migrate any
// of the existing Nevo dashboard implementation. This module is
// framework-independent — it knows nothing about Commander, argv, stdout, or
// exit codes. The `./cli` adapter owns the CLI concerns; this file owns the
// capability and returns a plain typed value.
