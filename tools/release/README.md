# `nevo-repo-release`

Repository-internal release + version tooling. Private, never published, and never a
`nevo-specflow` product surface (ADR 0005). The full flow is in
[`docs/engineering/repository/releasing.md`](../../docs/engineering/repository/releasing.md).

`version.json` at the repository root is `{ channel, version }` for whichever branch it
is on. SemVer parsing/compare is the `semver` package; only the channel/branch rules
are custom.

## Commands

TypeScript, `tsc` → `dist/`; the `nevo-release` executable is `dist/bin.js`. One
program, five subcommands, each owning its own options (`nevo-release <cmd> --help`):

```bash
nevo-release version [--with-sha]
    # CI build version from version.json + $GITHUB_* (run number 0 locally):
    # alpha/beta/rc -> <version>-<channel>.<run>; stable -> <version>; a tag ref -> its own version.

nevo-release check-transition [--json]
    # CI + local gate. A version.json change must be a legal transition (unchanged /
    # main-line bump / line cut / promotion) for the branch it lands on. The rules are
    # judged against the TARGET branch (PR base / pushed branch), never the head branch:
    # GITHUB_BASE_REF for a PR, the pushed branch (HEAD~1 base) for a push, or — locally —
    # inferred from the working-tree version.json channel (alpha -> main; a release
    # channel -> its origin/release/vX.Y). There is no BASE_REF override.

nevo-release cut-line --release-version X.Y.Z --next-development-version X.Y.Z [--execute]
    # Cut release/vX.Y off the current origin/main. ONE operation, explicit mutation
    # boundary: without --execute it runs EVERY read-only check (origin/main + its
    # version.json at the fetched base; an existing release/bump branch's *contents*;
    # PR state) and reports "would this succeed now?" — creating nothing. A dry run
    # that passes means the real run proceeds.
    #   - a prior run is recognised only by CONTENT: an existing release/vX.Y must be a
    #     single commit on an alpha <releaseVersion> base changing only version.json to
    #     beta <releaseVersion>; the bump branch (if present) the mirror on the same
    #     base. A merged bump PR (main already on the next alpha) = fully complete.
    #     Inconsistent contents -> fail closed, never overwritten / force-pushed.
    #     Its base must also be a real ancestor of origin/main (git merge-base
    #     --is-ancestor) — not an unrelated commit that happens to carry the right
    #     version.json. An open bump PR whose head branch is missing/invalid -> fail closed.
    #   - with --execute: create both branches by git plumbing (no working-tree change),
    #     then open the main-bump PR (CI_GITHUB_RELEASE_TOKEN present) or print the exact
    #     `gh pr create` command. Env fallbacks: RELEASE_VERSION, NEXT_DEVELOPMENT_VERSION.

nevo-release promote --target rc|stable [--execute]
    # Run on a release/vX.Y branch. Moves the branch's channel forward (beta->rc,
    # rc->stable) THROUGH A PR — never edits release/vX.Y directly, never tags.
    #   - fetch; require release/vX.Y; require local HEAD == origin/<branch>; read
    #     version.json from origin/<branch>; validate the transition with the shared
    #     domain rule (beta->stable rejected; already-target -> "already promoted";
    #     already-stable -> use Release stable).
    #   - recovery by STRUCTURE not name: an existing chore/promote-<v>-to-<target>
    #     (with or without an open PR) is reused only if it is a single commit on the
    #     current origin/<branch> HEAD changing only version.json to { target, v }.
    #     Open PR + missing/invalid branch -> fail closed. The result separates
    #     "the protected branch already carries { target, v }" (alreadyPromoted) from
    #     "a valid PR is open and still has to merge" (prPending) — an open unmerged
    #     PR is never reported as alreadyPromoted.
    #   - with --execute: push the branch by plumbing, open/hand off a PR titled
    #     `chore(release): promote <v> to <target>`, request auto-merge when the token
    #     is set. Auto-merge is CONVERGED: a re-run re-requests it on the existing
    #     valid PR. Env fallback: PROMOTE_TARGET, EXECUTE, CI_GITHUB_RELEASE_TOKEN_PRESENT.

nevo-release create --channel beta|rc|stable [--execute]
    # Run on a release/vX.Y branch. ONE operation, explicit mutation boundary: without
    # --execute it runs every read-only check and reports what would happen, changing
    # nothing. Checks (both modes):
    #   - after fetch, the local release-branch HEAD must equal origin/<branch> — a
    #     behind / diverged / unresolvable checkout is refused (§ stale checkout);
    #   - the branch HEAD must have PASSED quality + test + build + CodeQL on GitHub (newest run
    #     per check); an unreadable check-run response is refused;
    #   - Phase A — tag + GitHub Release: orphaned last prerelease tag on HEAD is
    #     completed, not skipped to N+1; a tag at a different commit is refused; if the
    #     Release state cannot be DETERMINED (auth/network/ambiguous) it fails closed,
    #     never assuming "absent".
    #   - Phase B (stable) — advance the branch, reached even when Phase A was a no-op.
    #     An existing advance branch is reused only when read-only Git inspection proves
    #     it is a single commit on the current origin/release/vX.Y HEAD changing only
    #     version.json to the expected next state. Extra file / wrong base / wrong
    #     content -> fail closed, never force-pushed, never turned into a PR. An open
    #     advance PR whose head branch is missing/invalid -> fail closed.
    #   - auto-merge: an auth/network failure is surfaced, not swallowed; a repo without
    #     auto-merge enabled is the one expected case and is reported accurately.
    # Env fallbacks: RELEASE_CHANNEL, EXECUTE, CI_GITHUB_RELEASE_TOKEN_PRESENT.
```

Root scripts `pnpm version:print` / `pnpm version:check-transition` call the built
`dist/bin.js`; the release / cut-release-line workflows build the package first.

## Architecture

```
src/
  domain/     version model · transitions · release/cut planning + decisions  (all pure)
  ports.ts    GitClient / GitHubClient interfaces
  infra/      git.ts (plumbing-based GitClient) · github.ts (gh CLI) · git-sync.ts (fast reads for the gate)
  app/        check-transition · build-version · cut-release-line · promote ·
              create-release · version-pr (the shared "change version.json via a PR" flow)
  cli/        thin Commander wiring; commands own their own options
  bin.ts      executable boundary
```

Application code never touches `child_process`, `process`, or stdio. `GitClient`
exposes only read-only history inspection (`commitParents`, `changedFiles`,
`showFileAtRef`, `resolveCommit`, `isAncestor`) plus the mutation methods, so the
structural recovery checks run without any plumbing writes. Errors: `UsageError`
(exit 2) / `InconsistentStateError` (exit 1), rendered only at the CLI boundary;
`--json` errors are structured.

`GitHubClient` reads **fail closed**. `releaseExists` decides absent-vs-existing-vs-
indeterminate from the **HTTP status code** of `gh api --include …/releases/tags/<tag>`
(200 / 404 / everything-else-throws), never by matching human `gh` stderr. `gh`
authenticates from `GH_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_TOKEN`; the adapter copies
`CI_GITHUB_RELEASE_TOKEN` into `GH_TOKEN` for its subprocesses only when neither is
already set (`resolveGhEnv`). Each release workflow's `permissions:` block is the
minimum for the APIs it calls — `release.yml` alone adds `checks: read`.

## Tests

`vitest run` (affected-aware via `turbo run test`): domain units, application-level
orchestration against in-memory `GitClient` / `GitHubClient` fakes (the full
create-release and cut-release-line scenario matrices), and a subprocess CLI smoke
suite.
